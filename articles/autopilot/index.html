We unconsciously do things that don‚Äôt add up to the life we want to live and we end up giving up choice.\nWhat is autopilot? Autopilot is a way for us human to automate the decision making process, that way we don‚Äôt overload our brain with information.\nThe problem is that modern life has become so fast paced that we can‚Äôt even think about what we want to do. We end up in autopilot without even realizing it.\nThis tends to happen at home the most. This prevents us to be able to make decisions that are important to us, like spending time with our family, or going to the gym.\nWe also tend to foget about important things while on autopilot, like the fact that we have to pay our bills or that we have to do our homework.\nPeople also have said that they tend to say yes to everything, even if it‚Äôs not what they want to do.\nWhat are the cultural conditions which drive autopilot today? People tend to stay with safe or known patterns and decisions, this is the least resistance path.\nModern life put people under three key pressures:\nWe are too busy to notice what decisions we make. The more distracted we are, the more difficult it is to make good decisions, the more we do, the less effective we are. We all have a lot of things to do and while trying to do all of it as fast as possible we end up doing less.\nTechnology makes us sleepwalk into our choices. Technology is the most powerful tool we have to make decisions, it lets us organize our life in ways that were not possible before. But while we have the tools to become better at what we do, we also have lots and lots of distractors, which lock us into spending more time on them and reduce our ability to make good, conscious decisions. We see an ad and immediately want to buy it even though we know we don‚Äôt really need it.\nWe spend too much time comparing ourselves to ideals we can‚Äôt live up to. While on the topic of social media, we tend to compare ourselves to the people we know, and we tend to feel that we have to live up to their lifestyle. This creates anxiety and makes us feel like we are not the best person we can be. It turns out that the more we value our happiness, the more likely we are to display symptoms of depression.\nAwareness of our own personal autopilot: which archetype are you? The first step into making the required changes is to be aware the impact autopilot has on our lives. Atopilot doesn‚Äôt affect us all in the same ways, so we need to be aware of the different types of autopilot.\nThe Pleasers The problem with pleasers is that they tend to always say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and end up with a pile of obligations and not focusing on what matters.\nWe all find it difficult to let people down sometimes, but these people need the conviction to say ‚Äúno‚Äù, otherwise they‚Äôll end up burnt-out and angry at themselves for always pleasing others instead of themselves.\nSolution Learn how to say no, but in a way that doesn‚Äôt make them feel bad, making them feel like you care. Find the right phrase for you and write it down. Make sure to see it everyday.\nThe Pacers The problem with pacers is that they tend to be too focused on what they want to do next, they are always busy ‚Äúdoing‚Äù instead of just ‚Äúbeing‚Äù.\nThey forget about what‚Äôs happening right now, they are so focused on rushing through the day that they tend to appreciate the moment they‚Äôre living.\nSolution Start figuring out what the important stuff is, instead of rushing through the day, find what is the most important thing to do right now and then do that first.\nSet a bedtime alarm, this will give you a chance to rest properly.\nThe Passengers The problem with passengers is that they allow the world to dictate what they do, they‚Äôre overwhelmed with choice and information.\nThey need to stop procrastinating and make those choices, even the difficult ones.\nSolution Commit to doing one thing differently each week, try new things rather than sticking to your normal habits.\nWrite a to-do list with the most important things you have to do and then do them.\nFrom autopilot to conscious decision-making We can turn our unconscious autopilot habits into active and positive ones, this will allow us to live life more purposefully and be more productive.\nAvoid comparisons with perfection Since we are all human, we can‚Äôt be perfect, so we shouldn‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôre supposed to be. Surround yourself with people that make you feel good about yourself.\nThe special things shouldn‚Äôt be reserved for special occasions Make the time to enjoy the special things, don‚Äôt leave them to be reserved for special occasions. Do them as often as you can.\nBe more intentional Make time for more conscious thinking, go through all the things you do and figure out which ones truly bring reward and happiness.\nLeading the life I want to live One of the worst things about autopilot is that we get caught up in obligations and routines and we lose track of our lives.\nChoose a meaningful and realistic goal to look forward to Do one thing to get started with your goal, then tell three people about it to make it a commitment.\nRe-set your mood Set your mood to be positive and optimistic by being active, this will help you to be more productive and more motivated.\nDon‚Äôt live someone else‚Äôs life, live your own Be real around people, don‚Äôt pretend to be perfect.\nDeepening connections and relationships Say ‚Äúhello‚Äù more, small gestures can make a really big difference\nSay ‚Äúthank you‚Äù more rather than taking people for granted.\nGive your full attention Don‚Äôt allow distractions interrupt your face-to-face conversations.\nScreen-free bedroom Make a rule to not allow screens at night, this will allow you to rest better.\nBecoming part of my wider community One way to live a more purposeful life is to be part of a community and part of something bigger.\nMake three extra connections today Stop to chat with someone, wave at a neighbor, or go out with friends.\nBe more charitable Volunteering for charity is a great way to make a difference in your community.\nMake more time Make more time to just be outside, enjoy nature, or just do something you enjoy.\n","wordCount":"1159","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-10-11T10:42:00Z","dateModified":"2021-10-11T10:42:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Eduardo Flores"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://apprentice.edfloreshz.dev/articles/autopilot/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"edfloreshz","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://apprentice.edfloreshz.dev/images/favicon/favicon.png"}}}</script>

<p>This subject was somewhat revealing to me, some know about autopilot but few of us ever notice it, we don&rsquo;t realize it can become a problem for us.</p>
<p>As life goes on we tend to do some things automatically, like going to the office, or using the internet, or even using the phone. We unconsciously do things that don&rsquo;t add up to the life we want to live and we end up giving up choice.</p>
<h1 id=what-is-autopilot>What is autopilot?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-autopilot>#</a></h1>
<p>Autopilot is a way for us human to automate the decision making process, that way we don&rsquo;t overload our brain with information.</p>
<p>The problem is that modern life has become so fast paced that we can&rsquo;t even think about what we want to do. We end up in autopilot without even realizing it.</p>
<p>This tends to happen at home the most. This prevents us to be able to make decisions that are important to us, like spending time with our family, or going to the gym.</p>
<p>We also tend to foget about important things while on autopilot, like the fact that we have to pay our bills or that we have to do our homework.</p>
<p>People also have said that they tend to say yes to everything, even if it&rsquo;s not what they want to do.</p>

<p>People tend to stay with safe or known patterns and decisions, this is the least resistance path.</p>
<p>Modern life put people under three key pressures:</p>
<h2 id=we-are-too-busy-to-notice-what-decisions-we-make>We are too busy to notice what decisions we make.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#we-are-too-busy-to-notice-what-decisions-we-make>#</a></h2>

<p>Technology is the most powerful tool we have to make decisions, it lets us organize our life in ways that were not possible before. But while we have the tools to become better at what we do, we also have lots and lots of distractors, which lock us into spending more time on them and reduce our ability to make good, conscious decisions.

<p>While on the topic of social media, we tend to compare ourselves to the people we know, and we tend to feel that we have to live up to their lifestyle. This creates anxiety and makes us feel like we are not the best person we can be. It turns out that the more we value our happiness, the more likely we are to display symptoms of depression.</p>

<h3 id=solution-1>Solution<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#solution-1>#</a></h3>
<p>Start figuring out what the important stuff is, instead of rushing through the day, find what is the most important thing to do right now and then do that first.</p>
<p>Set a bedtime alarm, this will give you a chance to rest properly.</p>
<h2 id=the-passengers>The Passengers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-passengers>#</a></h2>
<p>The problem with passengers is that they allow the world to dictate what they do, they&rsquo;re overwhelmed with choice and information.</p>
<p>They need to stop procrastinating and make those choices, even the difficult ones.</p>
<h3 id=solution-2>Solution<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#solution-2>#</a></h3>
<p>Commit to doing one thing differently each week, try new things rather than sticking to your normal habits.</p>
<p>Write a to-do list with the most important things you have to do and then do them.</p>
<h1 id=from-autopilot-to-conscious-decision-making>From autopilot to conscious decision-making<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#from-autopilot-to-conscious-decision-making>#</a></h1>
<p>We can turn our unconscious autopilot habits into active and positive ones, this will allow us to live life more purposefully and be more productive.</p>
<h2 id=avoid-comparisons-with-perfection>Avoid comparisons with perfection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#avoid-comparisons-with-perfection>#</a></h2>
<p>Since we are all human, we can&rsquo;t be perfect, so we shouldn&rsquo;t feel like we&rsquo;re supposed to be. Surround yourself with people that make you feel good about yourself.</p>
<h2 id=the-special-things-shouldnt-be-reserved-for-special-occasions>The special things shouldn&rsquo;t be reserved for special occasions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-special-things-shouldnt-be-reserved-for-special-occasions>#</a></h2>

<h2 id=be-more-intentional>Be more intentional<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#be-more-intentional>#</a></h2>
<p>Make time for more conscious thinking, go through all the things you do and figure out which ones truly bring reward and happiness.</p>
<h1 id=leading-the-life-i-want-to-live>Leading the life I want to live<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#leading-the-life-i-want-to-live>#</a></h1>
<p>One of the worst things about autopilot is that we get caught up in obligations and routines and we lose track of our lives.</p>

<p>Do one thing to get started with your goal, then tell three people about it to make it a commitment.</p>
<h2 id=re-set-your-mood>Re-set your mood<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#re-set-your-mood>#</a></h2>
<p>Set your mood to be positive and optimistic by being active, this will help you to be more productive and more motivated.</p>

<h1 id=deepening-connections-and-relationships>Deepening connections and relationships<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#deepening-connections-and-relationships>#</a></h1>
<p>Say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; more, small gestures can make a really big difference</p>
<p>Say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; more rather than taking people for granted.</p>
<h2 id=give-your-full-attention>Give your full attention<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#give-your-full-attention>#</a></h2>
