Reframe how you think about learning. Help reduce your frustration. Increase your understanding. Condense key ideas.  Modes of thinking Focused mode  You can focus on familiar thought patterns and solve them quickly. You can’t really deal with unfamiliar thoughts.  Diffuse mode  You can look at things broadly from a very different, big-picture perspective. You can make new neural connections traveling along new pathways. You can’t focus in as tightly as you often need to, to finalize any kind of problem solving.  History Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison They relaxed in a chair and let their mind go free. They’d have an object in their hand and the moment they fell asleep, they’d drop the object and the clatter would wake them up just in time so they could gather up those diffuse mode connections and ideas in their mind.\nWhat is learning?  The brain is the most complex device in the known universe. We are not consciously aware of how our brains work. Most of the heavyu lifting is done below our level of consciousness.  What we’ve learned…  Analogies provide powerful techniques for learning. Focused and diffuse mode. Learning something difficult takes time, you need to do a little work every day. How to take advantage of your unconscious mind, and also sleep, to make it easier to learn new things and solve problems.  Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep What will this course accomplish? We’ll get a little insight into procrastination, why it arises and a tool to help us address it.\nHow does procrastination work? When you get an unhappy feeling, your brain funnels the attention onto a more pleasant task, after that you feel temporarily happy.\nHow to address this? Pomodoro is a technique to help us focus, this is how it works:\n Set the timer to 25 minutes. Turn off all interruptions. Focus Reward  Almost anybody can focus for 25 minutes, it’s important to give yourself a little reward after.\nPractice makes permanent Neurons become linked together through repeatiton, the more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice, enough practice will concrete your neurological pathways.\nTake a break or at least change your focus to something different for awhile when you feel distracted. During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain’s diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding.\nIntroduction to Memory The two types of memory are related, sometimes you’ll need to bring thoughts from your long term memory to your working memory in order to think about them.\nLong term memory  Long term memory is like a storage warehouse, and just like a warehouse, it’s distributed over a big area. Different kinds of long-term memories are stored in different regions of the brain. The long-term memory storage warehouse is immense, it’s got room for billions of items. If you want to move information into your long-term memory, it often takes time and practice.  To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition. This technique involves repeating what you’re trying to retain, but what you want to do is a space this repetition out.\nRepeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique for example over a number of days.\nWorking memory  Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you’re immediately and consciously processing in your mind. When you encounter something new, you often use your working memory to handle it.  The importance of sleep in learning When you sleep, your brain cells shrink, this causes an increase in the space between your brain cells.\nTaking a test without getting enough sleep means you’re operating with a brain that got little metabolic toxins floating around in it, poisons, and make it so you can’t think very clearly.\nSleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you’re trying to learn.\nDreaming about what you’re studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand. It somehow consolidate your memories into easier to grasp chunks.\nAdvice from Dr. Sejnowski  He’s a firm believer in learning by doing. When you’re in a boring lecture, ask a question and start a discussion, that will make it a lot more interesting. To take advantage of diffuse mode, do things that you enjoy and take notes on what thoughts crossed your mind. New neurons are being born, even in adulthood. Have an enriched and stimulating environment. Don’t get hung up if you can’t answer a question in a test. Be passionate and persistent about what you do.
