summary: A conversation about autopilot and how it gets in the way of what matters to us.
---

This subject was somewhat revealing to me, some know about autopilot but few of us ever notice it, we don't realize it can become a problem for us.

As life goes on we tend to do some things automatically, like going to the office, or using the internet, or even using the phone. We unconsciously do things that don't add up to the life we want to live and we end up giving up choice.

# What is autopilot?

Autopilot is a way for us human to automate the decision making process, that way we don't overload our brain with information.

The problem is that modern life has become so fast paced that we can't even think about what we want to do. We end up in autopilot without even realizing it.

This tends to happen at home the most. This prevents us to be able to make decisions that are important to us, like spending time with our family, or going to the gym.

We also tend to foget about important things while on autopilot, like the fact that we have to pay our bills or that we have to do our homework.

People also have said that they tend to say yes to everything, even if it's not what they want to do.

# What are the cultural conditions which drive autopilot today?

People tend to stay with safe or known patterns and decisions, this is the least resistance path.

Modern life put people under three key pressures:

## We are too busy to notice what decisions we make.

The more distracted we are, the more difficult it is to make good decisions, the more we do, the less effective we are. We all have a lot of things to do and while trying to do all of it as fast as possible we end up doing less.

## Technology makes us sleepwalk into our choices.

Technology is the most powerful tool we have to make decisions, it lets us organize our life in ways that were not possible before. But while we have the tools to become better at what we do, we also have lots and lots of distractors, which lock us into spending more time on them and reduce our ability to make good, conscious decisions. We see an ad and immediately want to buy it even though we know we don't really need it.

## We spend too much time comparing ourselves to ideals we can't live up to.

While on the topic of social media, we tend to compare ourselves to the people we know, and we tend to feel that we have to live up to their lifestyle. This creates anxiety and makes us feel like we are not the best person we can be. It turns out that the more we value our happiness, the more likely we are to display symptoms of depression.

# Awareness of our own personal autopilot: which archetype are you?

The first step into making the required changes is to be aware the impact autopilot has on our lives. Atopilot doesn't affect us all in the same ways, so we need to be aware of the different types of autopilot.

## The Pleasers

The problem with pleasers is that they tend to always say "yes" and end up with a pile of obligations and not focusing on what matters.

We all find it difficult to let people down sometimes, but these people need the conviction to say "no", otherwise they'll end up burnt-out and angry at themselves for always pleasing others instead of themselves.

### Solution

Learn how to say no, but in a way that doesn't make them feel bad, making them feel like you care. Find the right phrase for you and write it down. Make sure to see it everyday.

## The Pacers

The problem with pacers is that they tend to be too focused on what they want to do next, they are always busy "doing" instead of just "being".

They forget about what's happening right now, they are so focused on rushing through the day that they tend to appreciate the moment they're living.

### Solution

Start figuring out what the important stuff is, instead of rushing through the day, find what is the most important thing to do right now and then do that first.

Set a bedtime alarm, this will give you a chance to rest properly.

## The Passengers

The problem with passengers is that they allow the world to dictate what they do, they're overwhelmed with choice and information.

They need to stop procrastinating and make those choices, even the difficult ones.

### Solution

Commit to doing one thing differently each week, try new things rather than sticking to your normal habits.

Write a to-do list with the most important things you have to do and then do them.

# From autopilot to conscious decision-making

We can turn our unconscious autopilot habits into active and positive ones, this will allow us to live life more purposefully and be more productive.

## Avoid comparisons with perfection

Since we are all human, we can't be perfect, so we shouldn't feel like we're supposed to be. Surround yourself with people that make you feel good about yourself.

## The special things shouldn't be reserved for special occasions

Make the time to enjoy the special things, don't leave them to be reserved for special occasions. Do them as often as you can.

## Be more intentional

Make time for more conscious thinking, go through all the things you do and figure out which ones truly bring reward and happiness.

# Leading the life I want to live

One of the worst things about autopilot is that we get caught up in obligations and routines and we lose track of our lives.

## Choose a meaningful and realistic goal to look forward to

Do one thing to get started with your goal, then tell three people about it to make it a commitment.

## Re-set your mood

Set your mood to be positive and optimistic by being active, this will help you to be more productive and more motivated.

## Donâ€™t live someone elseâ€™s life, live your own

Be real around people, don't pretend to be perfect.

# Deepening connections and relationships

Say "hello" more, small gestures can make a really big difference

Say "thank you" more rather than taking people for granted.

## Give your full attention

Don't allow distractions interrupt your face-to-face conversations.

## Screen-free bedroom

Make a rule to not allow screens at night, this will allow you to rest better.

# Becoming part of my wider community

One way to live a more purposeful life is to be part of a community and part of something bigger.

## Make three extra connections today

Stop to chat with someone, wave at a neighbor, or go out with friends.

## Be more charitable

Volunteering for charity is a great way to make a difference in your community.

## Make more time

Make more time to just be outside, enjoy nature, or just do something you enjoy.
