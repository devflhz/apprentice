# Ideas are made of other ideas.

All ideas are simply the combination of other ideas.
Almost every idea is based on another idea. What makes an idea special is how you can take previous ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense.

Creative people are usually those who don't intent to follow the rules and find solutions that others, who are constrained by the rules, can't.

We try to model our behavior in other creatives, but it's our uniqueness that makes things interesting.

## Creative thinking hacks

- **Combination**: How to combine two or more ideas in a different way.
- **Inhibition**: As you remove unnecessary assumptions, your solutions become more creative.
- **Environment**: Figure out how to make the environment work for you and your ideas.
- **Persistence**: Work hard and work smart.

## Advice:

- Creativity is a kind of work, a kind of effort.
- When you're stuck, now it's the time to be a creator.

# Hacks

## Journals

Keep some kind of journal. In order to be productive with your ideas you have to record them somewhere.

## Escaping

### Understanding

Learning about the problem and figuring out how it works.

### Incubation

Our subconscious is a place where ideas are born, we need let it process our understanding.

## Invert

In order to generate good ideas we first need to create an environment that will allow us to do that, the basis of the invert hack is to do the exact opposite of what we're trying to solve.

This is a very important step, because it's the first step to generate ideas, maybe we don't want to solve the opposite, but we give a chance for people to feel free to imagine how to solve a ridiculous problem.

Once they have that, you flip the goal and people will feel silly, liberated and fun and they will be able to generate ideas.

You could even invert the bad ideas to find a solution that works.

## Partnering

Pairing with someone else can be a great way to generate ideas that would've been impossible to generate alone.

## Failure

You will need to fail sometimes, if you're not failing, you're not doing something sufficiently difficult or creative.

## Switch Modes

Some ideas are easier to discover visually, verballly, audibly or physically. When you're stuck, find new ways to represent the problem. The process of explaining the problem changes how you think about the problem.
