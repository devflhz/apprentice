summary: Progress and change is something we all want, but few have honestly examined how it's done.

People are the ones who make progress happen, there is not change until someone does something different and this is directly correlated with the power that you have available to you.

# Change

People resist change, no matter how good or positive it is, change creates work.

We don't like change because:

- It creates work
- It requires thinking
- We have to talk and listen to each other
- It raises questions we'd prefer to avoid
- It puts us as risk of embarrassment.

Traditions protect against change, but they must be done knowing why it is important to do it that way, otherwise we risk doing things for the sake of following tradition and that may be a bad thing. Because the assumptions that were made a long time ago may not be valid anymore.

**Idea Killers** are the phrases that people tell you to avoid change and people don't usually expect you to have a response to these things, so you gotta be prepared.

We seek change when:

- Confronted with failure
- Witness peers succeeding through other means
- Are unhappy
- Are bored
- Confidence in change is greater than commitment to the status-quo

# Tactics you should use

- Line up the kind of power that you have with the kind of change you want to make.
- Persuasion is key, knowing how to sell an idea is what defines it as successful or not.
- Anticipation implies that you need to be thinking a few steps ahead depeding on what you do.

# Tactics you can use

## Playbook for individuals

- The idea of a **pilot** is to get a sense of how the idea will work in the real world.
- **Show success** by showing the pilot and give a sense of what you might be able to accomplish.
- **Find allies** to help you develop that idea.
- **Ask for more resources** to achieve your goal.
- Repeat the process.

## Playbook for managers

Managers should create an environment where people are rewarded for making progress.

- Do what we're rewarded for, they won't do more, just enough to get a reward.
- Hire for change, hire people tha will defy how things are done.
- Accept some ideas you don't like, you're not always going to get those ideas but that's precisely why you should accept them.
- Encourage interesting failures.
- Only you can provide cover fire
