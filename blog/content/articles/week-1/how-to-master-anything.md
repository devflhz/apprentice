---

As many people know, mastering anything can be a very difficult task, and it can be very hard to master anything at all. This video talks about how to ahieve mastery and which techniques can be used to make this process easier and more straightforward.

We might be under the impression that in order to master anything, repetition is the only way to go, but this is not the case. Simply doing something for hours is not guarantee that you'll improve.

# Acceptable performance

According to Anders Ericsson, doctors who have practiced for 20 years are not better than doctors that have practiced for 5 years if they feel that they've reached a level of **acceptable performance**. This is simply because in the absence of deliverate practice, the quantity and quality of mental representations is reduced by a great deal.

# Mental representations

Mental representations are ways to represent information in the mind.

Through mental representations, we can process information in a way that is easy to understand and easy to remember. Experts often do this in order to make hard or extensive processes easier to understand and remember. It helps recreate experiences, make accurate predictions, and condense information into seemingly simple mental representations.

This mental representations can take on the form of words, images and feelings.

# Core Components of 'Purposeful Practice'

1. First, having a well-defined, **specific goal**.
2. Second, practice sessions were periods of undistracted and **intense focus**.
3. Receive **immediate feedback** after each attempt.
4. Constantly being pushed out of his comfort zone, being in a **frequent discomfort** state.

This forces us to come up with creative mental representations and since our mind is conditioned to continue suffering unless we find a better way to do things, our mind comes up with different ways to solve problems.

# Delieverate Practice

The perfect formula for improvment is defined as `Purposeful Practice Methds + Expert Coaching`, which is a combination of the above 4 core components, plus being taught by an expert. This can significantly improve your chances of achieving mastery. Simply doing does not mean you'll improve.
