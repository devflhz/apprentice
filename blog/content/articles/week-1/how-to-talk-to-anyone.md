summary: Tips and tricks to talk to anyone.
---

This reading gave me a lot of insights about how to talk to anyone, I will take some of the tips and talk how they are relevant to me. When I was a child I was somewhat shy, I did not enjoy interacting with strangers. As time passed I realized that I would have to learn how to do that eventually, I managed to be social for most of my life but in college I started to learn how to talk to people.

I made some of my best friends during college and now, I have more tools to meet even more amazing people, here are some of them:

# How to Intrigue Everyone

People are usually driven by first impressions, in order to give a good impression, be confident around them.

This is something that has worked for me a lot of times, I have been able to give a good impression by following this technique.

## How to Make Your Smile Magically Different

Having a small pause before greeting someone with a smile will convince them that your smile is genuenly for them.

This technique is called **The Flooding Smile** and it is a great way to make your smile magical. You can try it out by yourself in the mirrror, or you can try it with a friend, this will give you more confidence.

## How to Use Your Eyes to Make Someone Fall in Love with You

Watch someone even when someone else is talking, no matter who's speaking.
It will make your target feel like you're extremely interested in them.

This technique is called **Epoxy Eyes** and it can sometimes be a dangerous technique, since it can make your target uncomfortable and accomplish the opposite.

## How to Start Great Small Talk

Small talk is not about facts. Small talk is about putting people at ease. You must first match your listener‚Äôs mood. Top communicators pick up on their listener‚Äôs tone of voice and duplicate it.

This is something I struggle with, I sometimes get frustrated and I don‚Äôt know how to start small talk, this happens more often with people I don‚Äôt know.

## How to Resuscitate a Dying Conversation

Listen to your conversation partner‚Äôs every word for clues to his or her preferred topic.

This is a great way to get back into a conversation you're interested in, specially useful for dates.

## How to Not Sound Anxious

Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved (and impressed) he or she will be.

This is something I struggle with sometimes, I tend to reply as fast as possible specially with people I'm nervous around.

## How to Make Them Want to Thank You

Never let the phrase ‚Äúthank you‚Äù stand alone. From A to Z, always follow it with for: from ‚ÄúThank you for asking‚Äù to ‚ÄúThank you for zipping me up.‚Äù

This is a great way to make someone feel like you're actually grateful for what he or she has done for you.

## How to Be a Modern Day Renaissance Man or Woman

Once a month, scramble your life. Do something you‚Äôd never dream of doing.

This is something I want to start doing, I sometimes feel like doing new things but routine always takes most of my time.

## How to Compliment Someone

A compliment one hears is never as exciting as the one he overhears. A priceless way to praise is not by telephone, not by telegraph, but by tell-a-friend.

This is something I've never tried and honestly think is a great way to compliment someone. I might try it out with a friend.

## How to Be a ‚ÄúCarrier Pigeon‚Äù of Good Feelings

Whenever you hear something complimentary about someone, fly to them with the compliment.

This is something I try to do constantly, I think it's important for people to feel good about themselves.

## How to Meet the People YOU Want to Meet

Do not stand around waiting for the moment when that special person approaches you . You make it happen by exploring every face in the room.

This is important to me, thanks to this I met important peolpe in my life, my partner, my friends, coworkers. If I had just stood there, I wouldn't have met them.

## How to Turn Their Anger Around

Facts speak. Emotions shout. Whenever you need facts from people about an emotional situation, let them emote.

Being able to manage your emotions in order to be smart about situations is a very important skill. Don't let others get the worst of you, be better than them.

## How to Make All the Right Moves

Like in chess, having a strategy is the key to winning. Before making a move, do a quick calculation and then make the move, take every factor you can into consideration in order to make the best move possible.
