Ideas are not the key to success, we all have ideas everyday and we don't always execute them. Execution is what matters.

# How does it work?

Imagine you have an idea, you can assign a value to it, let's say a good idea is worth $10, now let's imagine you execute such idea, if you do a good execution, you will be able to multiply those $10 by $10,000. You'll end up making $1,000,000!

That's a lot of money!

Now let's imagine you have a brilliant idea worth $20, but you don't do anything with it except maybe share it with a few of your pals. One of your friends thought your idea was excellent and he executed it brilliantly, he is now worth over $200,000,000!

The most brilliant idea, is just a multiplier of execution.
