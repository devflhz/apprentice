People who act out of desperation are very dangerous to be around as they become unpredictable. Fear is what makes us do illogical things even when we know they might not work out.

# How do we keep fear from damaging our lives?

We cannot eliminate fear, but we can reduce it.

## Red flag approach

Ask yourself, am I making a decision out of fear? The best way you can tell is if you're running away from something instead of running towards something
If so, you should think about making changes.

- Change the decision or change the situation.
- Figure out how to get yourself in a situation where you're not going to feel as much fear.

## What do you do about fear?

The solution to fear is power, the opposite of fear is confidence and what gives you confidence is power.
The way I think to have a fear-free life is to continually be developing skills so you don't feel afraid anymore.
So develop your powers.

## Learn how to harness the fear.

In some cases, fear is inevitable. The adrenaline you feel in situations where you feel nervous is an enormous source of power, you have all this adrenaline on your side and you didn't even have to take a pill, learn how to harness it to be better at what you do.
