summary: Advice on how to be better learners.
---

Imagine you have 3 boards:

1. A is for things you can't do yet.
2. B is for things you can do with effort.
3. C is for things you have mastered.

We need to get things out of A and into C as fast as possible.

# How do we do that?

The main reason people don't make progress is when there are too many things draining cognitive resources to ever effectively nail something and master it.

The second problem is when someone is making progress and out of the blue they just stop getting better, the main reason for this is that they have mastered the skill but it's not high quality.

The third problem is that it takes to long.

# How to fix the first issue?

You could try to keep more things on hold and just focus on the important stuff. You can do it in pieces.

The other thing to do is to split these tasks into subskills and master those. Then you'll become more effective.

## How to know if a subskill is small enough?

Take a skill from what you can't do yet and if you can master it in a maximum of 3 sessions of 45-90 minutes, you can consider it small enough.

# How to fix the second issue?

It is curcial to know when to stop spending time on the mediocre stuff and start focusing on the good stuff. Revisit the skills you've already mastered, check to see if you need to refine anything.

# How to fix the third issue?

We need to bypass the second board where we can and try to learn it without realizing it, we need to expose our brain to hundreds of high-quality samples of what we're trying to learn in a short period of time, and the brain will learn to automatically recognize patterns.
