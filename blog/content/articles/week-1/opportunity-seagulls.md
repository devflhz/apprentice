# What I learned...

We can help the company to grow by bringing in new clients. There are several ways to find new clients, one of the most effective way is to first have a good understanding of the company and its culture.

An uneffective way to find clients is to go knoking on every client's door and expecting them to be interested in the company.

A better way to approach this is to have a good understanding of the customer and their needs, finding a way to reach them in a way that is relevant to the company, like an email.

This way, your company looks like an opprortunity to solve a necessity rather than a problem.

They end up calling you and asking you to solve a problem instead of you calling them and asking them to solve your need for clients.
