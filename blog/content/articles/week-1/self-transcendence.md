summary: Why do we search for self-transcendence? Why do we attempt to lose ourselves?.

I'm not a religious person but I believe in self-transcendence, I believe in the power of the human spirit and cooperation. This talk was difficult to understand at first, but I think it's a good one.

Jonathan Haidt talks about the power of human cooperation, how we have evolved from individuals to become groups with common goals, values and beliefs. This is the story of human history. This is not exclusive to humans, we see this behaviour in animals, plants and other living things.

# Group selection

While talking about the evolution of human history, I found out that the group selection is one of the most important factors in human evolution.

From the beginning, humans acted as individuals and it was until they were able to find common interests and goals that they were able to form groups.

Jonathan defines this as a **superorganism**, it's so big and powerful that it's impossible to break it down.

# Cooperation

This leads to cooperation, which is the ability to work together in order to accomplish goals. These goals can either be for constructive purposes or for destructive purposes.

We see this behaviour in all kinds of species and perhaps the motivations might not be the same, but it's a common behaviour.
