summary: Improve the development process.
---

The development process improved significantly by applying the following techniques.

# General Process

The main idea is to look at the company as a whole and this means that even though you might not be included in every process, everybody is in charge of something and through collaboration you can make things happen.

## Journaling

One of the tools that will help you through the process is a research journal, this keep track of your process and that you or your peers can consult later to review past processes and ideas and be able to improve them.

# Problem Discovery

This is the first stage where you observe something, this process is about discovering the components of the problemm, their manifestations, and understanding their causes and effects.

- **Observation**: Observe the system, and try to understand it, list logs, reports, and data from other peers that could give you a clue on the system structure or flow
- **Data Gathering**: Gather all the data and look at it historically
- **Data Analysis**: Use the data you have to prove the ideas wrong or right.
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Now you should be able to generate some ideas of your own.
- **Experimental Design**: helps you be efficient and allows you to have a high degree of reliability on the results you get.
- **Tests**: These are a set of protocols that anyone can use to replicate your observations.

# Problem Definition

Define your problem in a single, simple sentence, but remember that there’s nothing wrong with having many definitions.

- **Definition**: The definition should be a single sentence that expresses the problem.
- **Constraints**: List all the conditions and their importance.

# Search For Solutions

This stage is where the actual ideas are born, gather with people, read, talk, draw, and generate some ideas on how you could solve the problem.

- **Research**: It’s always a good idea to research and look around to check if your idea has already been solved.

- **Scientific Papers**: The results need to be shown in a structured and formal way so that knowledge can be spread across the company.

- **Brainstorming**: Think about many possibilities, go crazy and come up with many ways to solve your problem.

- **Modeling**: This step is about discarding weird ideas that may not work and choosing the best one that fits into the constraints.

- **Prototyping**: A prototype is a simplified system that proves if the component can be built, and if it will work for the final solution

# Specification

The **specification** is the guide with which you build the solution.

- **Problem**: Choose one problem and work on it.

- **Background**: This is the summary of the previous work done on this problem.

- **Constraints**: The limitations of the system or program you are building must be exposed here.

- **Hypothesis**: It is a single sentence in which the solution is based.

- **Solution Proposal**: This is the general idea of the solution you came up with.

- **Theory Of Operation**: Explain how the program you are building works.

- **Black Box**: The black box section shows the main modules in an individual and simplified way.

- **Flow Diagram**: This is a graphical representation of the system you are building.

- **Functional Specification**: This is a detailed version of the solution proposal.

- **Technical Specification**: This is where you describe the steps to implement the solution with color codes, dimension sequences, algorithms, and protocols.

# Implementation

All the tickets are consumed on this stage, and work gets distributed. This where things actually happen.

# Data Aanlysis

Now that you completed the implementation, check if you did it right. Testing your hypothesis is the first step you have to take.
Your constraints should have some kind of test too. Gather all that data because you will need it to build a report on what you achieved

# Planning for the future

Once you’ve finished all the work, it’s time to think it over. Document what you did, what you accomplished, what you failed to do, what new ideas you can think of, what other approaches could be tried, and even write up some improvements or new ventures that could be interesting.
