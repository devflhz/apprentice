summary: This is a talk about how stereotyping and judging affects people and society at large.
---

We all judge people based on various factors, sometimes without even knowing who they are or where they come from. This comes from our evolutionary history, at that time we had to clasify others in order to survive.

# Stereotyping

Clasifying people affects how they develop and how they interact with others, and how they are perceived by others. It sets expectations and make people feel alienated when they are treated despectively.

This brings people apart.

# How to bring people together

Find something that affects all of them and make them work together to solve the problem. They will have to cooperate to solve the problem and labels will disolve.
