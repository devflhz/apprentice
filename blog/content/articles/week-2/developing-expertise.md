# The Dreyful Model

## Stage 1: Novice

- Don't want to learn, want to accomplish a goal.
- Are vulnerable to confusion
- Don't know how to respond to mistakes
- Rules-based, context free

# Stage 2: Advanced Beginner

- Start trying tasks on their own
- Have difficulties troubleshooting
- Want information fast
- Can place some advice in context required
- Begin to formulate some principles, but without holistic understanding

# Stage 3: Competent

- Develop conceptual models
- Troubleshoot problems on their own
- Seek out expert user advice
- Conscious, long-term plans and goals
- Beyond stimulus-response

# Stage 4: Proficient

- Want to understand the larger conceptual framework
- Are frustrated by oversimplified information
- Will self-correct previous poor task performance
- Learn from experience of others

# Stage 5: Expert

- They have so much context that they talk with metaphors
- Are primary sources of knowledge and information
- Continually look for better methods
- Work primarily from intuition, not reason
- Forcing to follow set of rules degrades performance.

You can't treat people uniformly, you have to figure out what their particular need are and be appropriate to them.

# Encoruage competence

- Re-examine training
- Keep experts in practice

# What can we do?

- Experience makes us valuable, make sure to gain as much experience as possible
- We need to apply lessons of financial management to our experience portfolio
  - Have a plan
  - Diversify
  - Look for value
