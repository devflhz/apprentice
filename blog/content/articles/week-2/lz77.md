summary: Understanding compression algorithms means understanding how humans view and use data.

The idea of transforming data into a more compressible state is the heart of all modern compression theory, and the basis of all modern compression algorithms.

Grouping symbols means looking at the data in pairs or groups of symbols. The objective here is to find the longest chains and the smallest entropy.

# LZ77 and LZ78

LZ77 and LZ78 are algorithms to find optimal tokenization of data, in 30+ years there hasn't been a better algorithm for this, it makes the backbone of all modern useful compressors.

### LZW

Will maintain a dictionary of symbols always trying to optimize for the longest match possible.

### LZSS

Will not omit a token if the token itself is longer than the string you're trying to compress.

### LZMA

Combines the LZ algorithm with Markov chains to produce better compression.
