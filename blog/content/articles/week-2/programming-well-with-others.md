# Collaboration

When you want to collaborate on a project, be sure to make it available to others as soon as possible. When people are looking for projects, they seek projects that are easy to work on and that are open to collaboration. If you open your project to the public too late and it's mostly done, no one will want to get involved.

# Be smart

Don't respond to provocative messages, you won't gain anything.

# Perception

Perception is very important; it can be key to the success of your project.

Showing yourself as someone trustworthy can get you a long way. Trust is what may define your success, if people trust you, they will most likely want support you or your ideas.
