# Some advice

- Companies are made of people, not code.
- Managers are not supposed to tell you what to do, they should remove blockers.
- Leave your comfort zone and do things that are interesting to you.
- Don't do everything you're told to do, question things.
- Try employees like an adult, expect them to what they have to do.
- You should take risks, failing does not mean failure, it means you're learning.

# Bad managers

Bad managers are too conservative, they are afraid of failure, think you serve them, they ignore low performers.

Beware of the office politician, they are the first ones to take credit and the first ones to assign blame. They put a lot of energy into looking impactful but not necessarily being impactful. Don't be passive with these people, they can end up being your manager.

# Bad companies

Bad companies have unrealistic expectations, they ask things due yesterday and expect you to do the impossible.

They don't trust you.

Directional chaos, they have many people in charge, the goal is constantly moving when many people are in charge.

# How to survive on a toxic environment

### Ask for forgiveness, not permission

Take risks, do what you think it's right without asking permission, ask for forgiveness later if you have to.

### Don't step in front of every train

Pick your battles, is it worth it? Spend your capital wisely.

### Sneak ideas in

Don't expect to get credit for everything, you can mention your ideas to others and let them take care of it.

### Work the ladder

Most companies have a ladder, there's a difference between doing the right thing and doing the right thing to get promoted.

### Manage "upward" perception.

Think about the perception of the people you work with, they are not the same as you and it matters a lot. Underpomise, overdeliver.

### Make influential friends

Meet people who are influential, they are the ones who will get you places you wouldn't be able to get otherwise.

#### The connectors

These people are focused on connecting with others.

#### The influencers

They know how the company works, they know everybody and are able to influence in the background.

### Don't mess with administrative assistants

Be polite, be nice, they can weild their executive power on you.

### Get in front of people

Make connections face to face, it will be way more effective.

### Learn how to ask a busy executive for anything

Be concise, send an email with three bullet points with 80 characters each, they will get what you're requesting quickly.

# Don't be a victim

If you can't make any progress, get out of there.
