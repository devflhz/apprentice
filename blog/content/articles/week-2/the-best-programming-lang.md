# Criteria for chosing the "best" language

## Productivity

Being able to prototype and test your code quickly is a must.
You should also be aware of the capabilities of the language you're chosing.

## Performance

Performance is a consideration that should be taken into account when you need your code to be performant, worrying about performance when its not really a priority is not a good idea.

## Reliability

How predictable is the language, how reliable is the code, how robust is the language?
This is not only about the program not crashing, but also about having predicable performance.

### PHP

As it turns out, PHP is actually very performant and reliable in comparison to other languages, I didn't know this.

## Portability

You should consider where you want to run your code and where you want to deploy it.

## Community

Havinga a big community of people who are interested in the language is an essential factor, without a community, who do you ask for help?

## What you already know

When you don't know exactly what you want to do, you can probably start with what you already know.

There's a great advantage to learn something new too, you'll be able to improve your skills.
