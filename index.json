Hypothesis Generation: Now you should be able to generate some ideas of your own. Experimental Design: helps you be efficient and allows you to have a high degree of reliability on the results you get. Tests: These are a set of protocols that anyone can use to replicate your observations.  Problem Definition Define your problem in a single, simple sentence, but remember that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with having many definitions.\n Definition: The definition should be a single sentence that expresses the problem. Constraints: List all the conditions and their importance.

We unconsciously do things that don\u0026rsquo;t add up to the life we want to live and we end up giving up choice.\nWhat is autopilot? Autopilot is a way for us human to automate the decision making process, that way we don\u0026rsquo;t overload our brain with information.\nThe problem is that modern life has become so fast paced that we can\u0026rsquo;t even think about what we want to do. We end up in autopilot without even realizing it.\nThis tends to happen at home the most. This prevents us to be able to make decisions that are important to us, like spending time with our family, or going to the gym.\nWe also tend to foget about important things while on autopilot, like the fact that we have to pay our bills or that we have to do our homework.\nPeople also have said that they tend to say yes to everything, even if it\u0026rsquo;s not what they want to do.\nWhat are the cultural conditions which drive autopilot today? People tend to stay with safe or known patterns and decisions, this is the least resistance path.\nModern life put people under three key pressures:\nWe are too busy to notice what decisions we make. The more distracted we are, the more difficult it is to make good decisions, the more we do, the less effective we are. We all have a lot of things to do and while trying to do all of it as fast as possible we end up doing less.\nTechnology makes us sleepwalk into our choices. Technology is the most powerful tool we have to make decisions, it lets us organize our life in ways that were not possible before. But while we have the tools to become better at what we do, we also have lots and lots of distractors, which lock us into spending more time on them and reduce our ability to make good, conscious decisions. We see an ad and immediately want to buy it even though we know we don\u0026rsquo;t really need it.\nWe spend too much time comparing ourselves to ideals we can\u0026rsquo;t live up to. While on the topic of social media, we tend to compare ourselves to the people we know, and we tend to feel that we have to live up to their lifestyle. This creates anxiety and makes us feel like we are not the best person we can be. It turns out that the more we value our happiness, the more likely we are to display symptoms of depression.\nAwareness of our own personal autopilot: which archetype are you? The first step into making the required changes is to be aware the impact autopilot has on our lives. Atopilot doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect us all in the same ways, so we need to be aware of the different types of autopilot.\nThe Pleasers The problem with pleasers is that they tend to always say \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; and end up with a pile of obligations and not focusing on what matters.\nWe all find it difficult to let people down sometimes, but these people need the conviction to say \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;, otherwise they\u0026rsquo;ll end up burnt-out and angry at themselves for always pleasing others instead of themselves.\nSolution Learn how to say no, but in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them feel bad, making them feel like you care. Find the right phrase for you and write it down. Make sure to see it everyday.\nThe Pacers The problem with pacers is that they tend to be too focused on what they want to do next, they are always busy \u0026ldquo;doing\u0026rdquo; instead of just \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo;.\nThey forget about what\u0026rsquo;s happening right now, they are so focused on rushing through the day that they tend to appreciate the moment they\u0026rsquo;re living.\nSolution Start figuring out what the important stuff is, instead of rushing through the day, find what is the most important thing to do right now and then do that first.\nSet a bedtime alarm, this will give you a chance to rest properly.\nThe Passengers The problem with passengers is that they allow the world to dictate what they do, they\u0026rsquo;re overwhelmed with choice and information.\nThey need to stop procrastinating and make those choices, even the difficult ones.\nSolution Commit to doing one thing differently each week, try new things rather than sticking to your normal habits.\nWrite a to-do list with the most important things you have to do and then do them.\nFrom autopilot to conscious decision-making We can turn our unconscious autopilot habits into active and positive ones, this will allow us to live life more purposefully and be more productive.\nAvoid comparisons with perfection Since we are all human, we can\u0026rsquo;t be perfect, so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t feel like we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be. Surround yourself with people that make you feel good about yourself.\nThe special things shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be reserved for special occasions Make the time to enjoy the special things, don\u0026rsquo;t leave them to be reserved for special occasions. Do them as often as you can.\nBe more intentional Make time for more conscious thinking, go through all the things you do and figure out which ones truly bring reward and happiness.\nLeading the life I want to live One of the worst things about autopilot is that we get caught up in obligations and routines and we lose track of our lives.\nChoose a meaningful and realistic goal to look forward to Do one thing to get started with your goal, then tell three people about it to make it a commitment.\nRe-set your mood Set your mood to be positive and optimistic by being active, this will help you to be more productive and more motivated.\nDon‚Äôt live someone else‚Äôs life, live your own Be real around people, don\u0026rsquo;t pretend to be perfect.\nDeepening connections and relationships Say \u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo; more, small gestures can make a really big difference\nSay \u0026ldquo;thank you\u0026rdquo; more rather than taking people for granted.\nGive your full attention Don\u0026rsquo;t allow distractions interrupt your face-to-face conversations.\nScreen-free bedroom Make a rule to not allow screens at night, this will allow you to rest better.\nBecoming part of my wider community One way to live a more purposeful life is to be part of a community and part of something bigger.\nMake three extra connections today Stop to chat with someone, wave at a neighbor, or go out with friends.\nBe more charitable Volunteering for charity is a great way to make a difference in your community.\nMake more time Make more time to just be outside, enjoy nature, or just do something you enjoy.\n","permalink":"https://apprentice.edfloreshz.dev/articles/autopilot/","summary":"A conversation about autopilot and how it gets in the way of what matters to us.","title":"üö® Autopilot Britain"},{"content":"Imagine you have 3 boards:\n A is for things you can\u0026rsquo;t do yet.

This video talks about how to ahieve mastery and which techniques can be used to make this process easier and more straightforward.\nWe might be under the impression that in order to master anything, repetition is the only way to go, but this is not the case. Simply doing something for hours is not guarantee that you\u0026rsquo;ll improve.\nAcceptable performance According to Anders Ericsson, doctors who have practiced for 20 years are not better than doctors that have practiced for 5 years if they feel that they\u0026rsquo;ve reached a level of acceptable performance. This is simply because in the absence of deliverate practice, the quantity and quality of mental representations is reduced by a great deal.\nMental representations Mental representations are ways to represent information in the mind.\nThrough mental representations, we can process information in a way that is easy to understand and easy to remember. Experts often do this in order to make hard or extensive processes easier to understand and remember. It helps recreate experiences, make accurate predictions, and condense information into seemingly simple mental representations.\nThis mental representations can take on the form of words, images and feelings.\nMental representations explain the difference between notivces and experts. - Anders Ericsson Core Components of \u0026lsquo;Purposeful Practice\u0026rsquo;  First, having a well-defined, specific goal. Second, practice sessions were periods of undistracted and intense focus. Receive immediate feedback after each attempt. Constantly being pushed out of his comfort zone, being in a frequent discomfort state.  This forces us to come up with creative mental representations and since our mind is conditioned to continue suffering unless we find a better way to do things, our mind comes up with different ways to solve problems.\nDelieverate Practice The perfect formula for improvment is defined as Purposeful Practice Methds + Expert Coaching, which is a combination of the above 4 core components, plus being taught by an expert. This can significantly improve your chances of achieving mastery. Simply doing does not mean you\u0026rsquo;ll improve.\nThe right sort of practice carried out over a sufficient period of time leads to improvement, nothing else will. - Anders Ericsson ","permalink":"https://apprentice.edfloreshz.dev/articles/how-to-master-anything/","summary":"How to master anything?.","title":"üßëüèΩ‚Äçüè´ How to master anything"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m not a religious person but I believe in self-transcendence, I believe in the power of the human spirit and cooperation.

Reframe how you think about learning. Help reduce your frustration. Increase your understanding. Condense key ideas.  Modes of thinking Focused mode  You can focus on familiar thought patterns and solve them quickly. You can\u0026rsquo;t really deal with unfamiliar thoughts.  Diffuse mode  You can look at things broadly from a very different, big-picture perspective. You can make new neural connections traveling along new pathways. You can\u0026rsquo;t focus in as tightly as you often need to, to finalize any kind of problem solving.  History Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison They relaxed in a chair and let their mind go free. They\u0026rsquo;d have an object in their hand and the moment they fell asleep, they\u0026rsquo;d drop the object and the clatter would wake them up just in time so they could gather up those diffuse mode connections and ideas in their mind.\nWhat is learning?  The brain is the most complex device in the known universe. We are not consciously aware of how our brains work. Most of the heavyu lifting is done below our level of consciousness.  What we\u0026rsquo;ve learned\u0026hellip;  Analogies provide powerful techniques for learning. Focused and diffuse mode. Learning something difficult takes time, you need to do a little work every day. How to take advantage of your unconscious mind, and also sleep, to make it easier to learn new things and solve problems.  Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep What will this course accomplish? We\u0026rsquo;ll get a little insight into procrastination, why it arises and a tool to help us address it.\nHow does procrastination work? When you get an unhappy feeling, your brain funnels the attention onto a more pleasant task, after that you feel temporarily happy.\nHow to address this? Pomodoro is a technique to help us focus, this is how it works:\n Set the timer to 25 minutes. Turn off all interruptions. Focus Reward  Almost anybody can focus for 25 minutes, it\u0026rsquo;s important to give yourself a little reward after.\nPractice makes permanent Neurons become linked together through repeatiton, the more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice, enough practice will concrete your neurological pathways.\nTake a break or at least change your focus to something different for awhile when you feel distracted. During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain\u0026rsquo;s diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding.\nIntroduction to Memory The two types of memory are related, sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll need to bring thoughts from your long term memory to your working memory in order to think about them.\nLong term memory  Long term memory is like a storage warehouse, and just like a warehouse, it\u0026rsquo;s distributed over a big area. Different kinds of long-term memories are stored in different regions of the brain. The long-term memory storage warehouse is immense, it\u0026rsquo;s got room for billions of items. If you want to move information into your long-term memory, it often takes time and practice.  To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition. This technique involves repeating what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to retain, but what you want to do is a space this repetition out.\nRepeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique for example over a number of days.\nWorking memory  Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you\u0026rsquo;re immediately and consciously processing in your mind. When you encounter something new, you often use your working memory to handle it.  The importance of sleep in learning When you sleep, your brain cells shrink, this causes an increase in the space between your brain cells.\nTaking a test without getting enough sleep means you\u0026rsquo;re operating with a brain that got little metabolic toxins floating around in it, poisons, and make it so you can\u0026rsquo;t think very clearly.\nSleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to learn.\nDreaming about what you\u0026rsquo;re studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand. It somehow consolidate your memories into easier to grasp chunks.\nAdvice from Dr. Sejnowski  He\u0026rsquo;s a firm believer in learning by doing. When you\u0026rsquo;re in a boring lecture, ask a question and start a discussion, that will make it a lot more interesting.
